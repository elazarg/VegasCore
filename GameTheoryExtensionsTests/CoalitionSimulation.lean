/-! # A channel that only a coalition can use

The base game draws a fair coin, one player has nothing to do, and the other is
paid for guessing the coin. No strategy sees the draw, so every profile is worth
one half to both players, and every profile is strong Nash.

The target game is the same draw with a channel: the first player's strategy is
a message chosen as a function of the coin, and the second player's strategy is
a guess chosen as a function of the received message. Compiling a base strategy
sends a constant message and ignores the received one.

A lone deviator gains nothing: against a constant message the guess is constant,
and a message nobody listens to changes no outcome. So the compiled embedding
carries an exact one-player certificate. The two-player coalition that sends the
coin and copies it is worth one, so no coalition certificate exists at all, for
any strategy translation, and strong Nash is not preserved.

This is why `UtilitySimulation` is indexed by the coalitions it covers: the
one-player certificate does not supply the coalition one, and exactness at one
player does not help.
