/-! # An interleaved restricted menu

After Bob's observed reply, Alice may select either of two outcomes or withhold.
The command selecting a given outcome depends on the reply. Opposite utilities
have no common optimal randomized continuation. This checks the local payoff
argument; `scripts/experiments/coalescing.py` separately enumerates the complete
finite games, their information sets, proper roots, and pure SPE profiles.
Neither artifact supplies a coalesced native-service adapter.
