/-! # An optimal plan does not determine optimal restricted continuations

Both utility profiles select `a` in the full one-decision game. When a native
prefix leaves only `b` and `c` available, their best replies disagree. No
randomized continuation is optimal for both. A utility-independent compiler
cannot recover this missing ranking from the common source plan alone.
