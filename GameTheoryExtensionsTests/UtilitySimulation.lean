/-! # Utility-simulation regressions

The existing three-layer finite-mixture fixture is interpreted with a concrete
Boolean utility.  Its composed utility simulation must bound the genuinely
mixed target deviation by the profitable pure source action and preserve the
same approximate-Nash error at the compiled profile.
